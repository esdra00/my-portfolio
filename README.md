# Esdra Bergamasco - Portfolio

I built from scratch my own website, fully responsive with a focus on micro-interactions. I choose to not use any framework and reserving them for other project. My portfolio aim to show my abilities as a front-end developer but in it you can also find a collection of all my other projects I consider worth showcasing.

## Overview

I started building my portfolio on Figma, after putting togheter my thounghts and a few sketches I finally came up with the blueprint. From that I started building it from a blank vite react template preset. I used Sass and scss modules to style it while Framer helped me create the various animation. Using Formik in combination with Yup for validation and EmailJs to send email I implemented a contatc form for various type of feedback.
