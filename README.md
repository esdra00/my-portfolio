# Esdra Bergamasco - Portfolio

I personally designed every aspect of this portfolio using Figma, the industry-leading design tool. This platform serves as a showcase of my expertise as a Front-End Web Developer, encompassing a collection of carefully curated projects that I consider worth showcasing. These projects aim to demonstrate my versatility and proficiency across various domains.

## Overview

I started building my portfolio on Figma, after putting togheter my thounghts and a few sketches I finally came up with the blueprint. From that I started building it from a blank vite react template preset. I used Sass and scss modules to style it while Framer helped me create the various animation. Using Formik in combination with Yup for validation and EmailJs to send email I implemented a contatc form for various type of feedback.
